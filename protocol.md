# Client → Server

## Common fields

These are included in every message (except if specified), and will not be repeated afterwards.

```json
{
    "action": "action-name",
    "uuid": "the-user-assigned-uuid-or-null-to-get-one",
    "secret": "the-user-assigned-secret-or-null-to-get-one",
    "slug": "the-game-slug"
}
```

- If the `uuid` field is `null` or undefined, the server will send a `set-uuid` message.
- If the `secret` field is `null` or undefined or invalid, and the `uuid` field is set, the message will be rejected.

## `join-game`

The client asks to join a game.

```json
{
    "pseudonym": "The requested pseudonym"
}
```

If the `slug` is set, the server will add the player to this game if it exists; creating a new one else (either if the `slug` is `null` or unknown).

Will answer with `set-slug` to set the game slug (if the game exists, it will be the same slug as the one sent), and with one `player-join` for every player in the game (including the client that sent the message).

## `update-config`

The client updates the configuration of the game.

```json
{
    "configuration": {
        "categories": [
            "Category 1",
            "Category 2"
        ],
        "stopOnFirstCompletion": false,
        "turns": 4,
        "time": 180
    }
}
```

If the client is not master and the _categories by everyone_ mode is disabled, or if the game's state is not `CONFIG`,
the update will be ignored and a `config-updated` message will be replied with the previous configuration to reset it.

Else, a `config-updated` message will be broadcasted to the players of the game (excluding the client that sent the message),
and the new configuration saved server-side.

If the _categories by everyone_ mode is enabled and the sender is not master, non-categories changes will be discarded.

## `lock-game`

Asks the server to (un)lock the game, preventing any new player to join. If the sender is not master, the message is ignored.

```json
{
  "locked": true
}
```

## `switch-master`

Asks the server to give master power to a specific player. If the sender is not master, the message is ignored.

```json
{
  "master": {
    "uuid": "the new master's UUID"
  }
}
```

## `kick-player`

Asks the server to kick a specific player. If the sender is not master, the message is ignored.

```json
{
  "kick": {
    "uuid": "the kicked player's UUID"
  }
}
```

## `change-categories-by-everyone`

Changes whether everyone can edit the categories and not only the game master.

```json
{
  "enabled": true
}
```

## `start-game`

Starts the game.

```json
{}
```

The message will be ignored if the sender is not master.

## `send-answers`

In the active part of a round, sends answers for the current letter.

```json
{
    "answers": {
        "Category 1": "The answer",
        "Category 2": "The answer"
    }
}
```

If `stopOnFirstCompletion` is set to `true`, this will end the current round's active phase.

## `send-vote`

In the voting part of a round, sends a vote on one's answer. `true` to accept the answer; `false` to reject it.

```json
{
    "vote": {
        "uuid": "The UUID of the player who wrote the answer",
        "category": "The voted category",
        "vote": true
    }
}
```

## `vote-ready`

Indicates that the client votes are done and that we can go to the next round. When every logged-in client are ready, the next round starts automatically.

```json
{}
```

## `restart`

During the end screen, the client asks to restart the game.

```json
{}
```

The message will be ignored if the sender is not master, or if we're not in the `FINAL` game state.

# Server → Client

## Common fields

These are included in every message, and will not be repeated afterwards.

```json
{
    "action": "action-name"
}
```

## `set-server-runtime-identifier`

Sets an identifier that the client must save (only in the page memory, it should not persist over reloads). When the client is disconnected, when it reconnects, it should check the identifier sent and compare it with the one stored, and force-reload if they differ—this means the game server rebooted and the current game is lost.

It is also used when the player was idle in the tab out of a game for way too long, disconnected, and its server-side client reference was cleaned up.

```json
{
  "runtime_identifier": "a string identifier"
}
```

## `set-uuid`

Sets the client's UUID, and a secret for simple auth, to be sent in every subsequent message.

```json
{
    "uuid": "the-user-assigned-uuid",
    "secret": "a-secret-to-authenticate-users"
}
```

## `set-slug`

Sets the game's slug, to be sent in every subsequent message, and to be reflected into the URL / share box.

```json
{
    "slug": "the-game-slug"
}
```

## `kick`

Indicates that the player was kicked from the game. If `locked` is true, that's because the game was locked.

```json
{
    "locked": true
}
```

## `player-join`

Indicates that a player joined the game. Also used when a player joins the game to send it all other already-connected players.

```json
{
    "player": {
        "uuid": "8b42a578-5948-4237-8db0-cae73ff16699",
        "pseudonym": "The Pseudonym",
        "ready": true,
        "master": false
    }
}
```

## `player-left`

Indicates that a player left the game.

```json
{
    "player": {
        "uuid": "8b42a578-5948-4237-8db0-cae73ff16699"
    }
}
```

## `set-master`

Indicates that the master player has changed.

```json
{
  "master": {
    "uuid":"8b42a578-5948-4237-8db0-cae73ff16699"
  }
}
```

## `set-suggested-categories`

Sends suggested categories to the client. These are used for autocompletion in the configuration form.

```json
{
  "categories": [
    "Category 1",
    "Category 2"
  ]
}
```

## `config-updated`

Indicates that the game's config has changed.

```json
{
    "configuration": {
        "categories": [
            "Category 1",
            "Category 2"
        ],
        "stopOnFirstCompletion": false,
        "turns": 4,
        "time": 180
    }
}
```

## `game-locked`

Indicates that the game's locked (or not).

```json
{
  "locked": true
}
```

## `categories-by-everyone`

Indicates whether everyone can edit the categories and not only the game master. This message is also sent to new
players joining the game, if the mode is enabled.

```json
{
  "enabled": true
}
```

## `catch-up-game-state`

Sent when someone joins the game after its beginning. This message allows the client to sync up with the game.

```json
{
  "state": "ROUND_ANSWERS",
  "countdown": 2,
  "round": {
    "round": 1,
    "letter": "E",
    "time_left": 28,
    "players_ready": [
      "a-player-uuid",
      "a-player-uuid"
    ]
  },
  "vote": {
    "answers": {
      "the same structure": "as in `vote-started`"
    },
    "interrupted": "a-player-uuid-or-null",
    "players_ready": [
      "a-player-uuid",
      "a-player-uuid"
    ]
  },
  "end": {
    "scores": [
      "the same structure",
      "as in `game-ended`"
    ]
  }
}
```

The `CONFIG` state can be ignored as if someone logs out during config, it is removed.

Of this JSON message, only the `state` key and another relevant one is sent. The state can be:

- `ROUND_ANSWERS_COUNTDOWN`: the countdown before the beginning of a round (other key: `countdown`);
- `ROUND_ANSWERS`: the main part of a round, where players fill the answers (other key: `round`);
- `ROUND_VOTES`: the voting part of a round, where players vote for other answers (other key: `vote`);
- `END`: the end screen of the game (other key: `end`).

If the internal state is `ROUND_ANSWERS_FINAL`, we send `ROUND_ANSWERS` and consider that the final answers were sent (no time to fill them anyway).

`time_left` is in seconds, and will be `null` for infinite rounds.

## `round-starts-soon`

Indicates that the round will start soon. The client shoud display a countdown with the given number of seconds.

```json
{
  "countdown": 3
}
```

## `round-started`

Indicates that a new round starts. It will end when a `round-ended` message is received.

When received, all players must be marked as non-ready.

```json
{
    "round": 1,
    "letter": "E"
}
```

## `player-ready`

Indicates that a player is ready.

```json
{
    "player": {
        "uuid": "the-user-assigned-uuid"
    }
}
```

## `round-ended`

Indicates that a round just ended.

When this message is received, the client must send its final submissions with `send-answers`, and display a loading screen until `vote-started` is received.

```json
{}
```

## `vote-started`

Indicates that the voting process starts.

```json
{
    "answers": {
        "Category 1": {
            "a-player-uuid": {
              "answer": "This player's answer",
              "valid": true,
              "votes": {
                  "a-player-uuid": true,
                  "a-player-uuid": true,
                  "a-player-uuid": true,
                  "a-player-uuid": true,
                  "a-player-uuid": true
              },
            }
        }
    },
    "interrupted": "a-player-uuid-or-null"
}
```

In the `answers` object, `answer` is the answer's text, and `votes` contains the initial votes for each player: all values will be `true` if the answer respects the basic rules of the game (i.e. starts with the correct letter, accents and such removed); `false` else.

If the game is set to be interrupted on first completion, `interrupted` will be set to the UUID of the interrupting player. Else, it will be set to `null`.

## `vote-changed`

Indicates that someone updated their vote.

```json
{
    "voter": {
        "uuid": "the-user-assigned-uuid"
    },
    "vote": {
        "uuid": "The UUID of the player who wrote the answer",
        "category": "Category 1",
        "vote": true
    }
}
```

## `game-ended`

Indicates that the game ended and that the client should display the final scores.

```json
{
    "scores": [
        {
            "uuid": "a-player-uuid",
            "score": 243,
            "rank": 1
        },
        {
            "uuid": "a-player-uuid",
            "score": 242,
            "rank": 2
        },
        {
            "uuid": "a-player-uuid",
            "score": 141,
            "rank": 3
        },
    ]
}
```

## `game-restarted`
